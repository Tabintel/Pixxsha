## Features

- **Secure Storage with IPFS**  
  Your photos are safely stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), ensuring that they remain accessible, decentralized, and secure at all times. We use [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) to handle the IPFS integration, providing a reliable and efficient way to manage your photo uploads.

- **Smart and Flexible Sharing**  
  Share your photos through different options:
  - **Public Links**: Share a photo with the world.
  - **Restricted Links**: Control who can view your photos by specifying access.
  - **View Once Links**: Send temporary links that expire after a single view.

- **Organized Memories**  
  Keep your memories in order by creating customized groups like "Summer Vacation 2023" or "Family Album." Pixxsha makes it easy to organize photos for any event or theme.

## How It Works

### 1. Uploading Photos
You can upload photos to Pixxsha directly from your mobile or PC/Mac device. Each photo is securely stored on IPFS via **Pinataâ€™s service**, giving it a unique IPFS hash.

### 2. Sharing Options
Once uploaded, you can share photos in various ways:
- **Public**: Anyone with the link can view the photo.
- **View Once**: The link is active only once, providing extra privacy.
- **Restricted**: Specify who can access the photo by adding specific email addresses.

### 3. Group and Organize
Pixxsha lets you create custom groups to keep your photos well-organized. For example, you can have groups like "Family Gatherings," "Graduations," or "Vacations" to relive specific moments.
